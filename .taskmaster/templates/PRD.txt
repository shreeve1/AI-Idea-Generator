Overview
IdeaStream is a web application that leverages AI integration with ChatGPT to help users generate creative ideas across multiple categories. The application addresses the common problem of creative blocks and the need for inspiration by providing an intuitive platform that generates contextually relevant ideas based on user-selected categories and preferences.

The web app serves both casual users seeking quick inspiration and registered users who want to save, organize, and build upon their generated ideas over time. By combining the power of AI with user-friendly categorization and personalization features, IdeaStream aims to become the go-to platform for idea generation and creative brainstorming.

Core Problem Statement: Many individuals and professionals struggle with creative blocks when trying to generate new ideas for personal projects, business ventures, or creative endeavors. Current solutions are either too generic, lack categorization, or don't provide a way to save and iterate on ideas over time.

Core Features
AI-Powered Idea Generation Engine
The heart of the application is its ChatGPT integration that processes user inputs and category selections to generate relevant, creative ideas. The system accepts user prompts and applies category-specific context to produce tailored suggestions that align with the selected domain.

How it works: Users input a basic prompt or question, select one or more categories (Personal, Technology, Finance, Marketing, Productivity, Pets, Design), and the AI generates 3-5 relevant ideas with explanations and potential next steps.

Why it's important: This feature provides the core value proposition by leveraging advanced AI capabilities to overcome creative blocks and provide inspiration that users wouldn't have generated independently.

Category-Based Filtering System
A sophisticated filtering mechanism allows users to influence idea generation by selecting from seven predefined categories: Personal, Technology, Finance, Marketing, Productivity, Pets, and Design. Each category provides contextual guidance to the AI, ensuring generated ideas are relevant and actionable.

How it works: Users can select multiple categories simultaneously, and the AI weights its responses accordingly. The system maintains category-specific prompts and contexts that guide the AI's idea generation process.

Why it's important: Categorization ensures ideas are relevant to users' specific interests and needs, reducing time spent filtering through irrelevant suggestions and increasing the likelihood of actionable outcomes.

Guest Mode Idea Generation
The application provides full idea generation functionality without requiring user registration, allowing for immediate value delivery and reducing barriers to entry. Guest users can access all core features except saving and organizing ideas.

How it works: Anonymous users can input prompts, select categories, and receive AI-generated ideas without creating an account. Sessions are temporary, and no data is stored permanently.

Why it's important: This approach reduces friction for first-time users, allows for immediate value demonstration, and serves as a conversion funnel for user registration.

User Authentication and Profile Management
A secure authentication system enables users to create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized features. The system supports both email/password authentication and potential social login integration.

How it works: Users register with email and password, receive verification emails, and can securely log in to access their saved content. The system maintains user sessions and provides password recovery functionality.

Why it's important: Authentication enables personalization, content saving, and long-term user engagement while maintaining security and privacy standards.

Idea Saving and Organization
Registered users can save generated ideas to their personal profiles, creating a repository of inspiration for future reference. Ideas are stored with timestamps, categories, and original prompts for easy retrieval and organization.

How it works: Each saved idea includes the generated content, associated categories, creation timestamp, and optional user notes. Users can organize ideas by category, date, or custom tags.

Why it's important: This feature transforms the app from a one-time use tool to a long-term creative companion, increasing user retention and providing ongoing value.
