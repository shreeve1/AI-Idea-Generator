		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Project Setup and Server Initialization",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the backend setup task into subtasks covering project initialization, directory structure creation, environment variable management, server entry point implementation, and middleware integration with health check endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct steps including project initialization, folder structuring, environment configuration, server setup, and middleware integration. Each step requires specific actions and testing, making it moderately complex and naturally divisible into at least five subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Implementation (PostgreSQL)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation into subtasks for designing User, Category, and Idea models, defining relationships and constraints, and seeding initial category data.",
			"reasoning": "Designing and implementing a relational database schema with multiple entities and relationships requires careful planning and testing. Separating model definitions, relationship constraints, and data seeding into subtasks will improve clarity and manageability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "User Authentication Service with JWT",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication service into subtasks for registration endpoint, login endpoint with JWT generation, password hashing, email verification flow, and authentication middleware implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication involves multiple security-sensitive components including password hashing, token management, email verification, and protected route middleware. Each component requires focused development and testing, justifying multiple subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "AI Integration Service for ChatGPT",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the AI integration service into subtasks for prompt construction, API call implementation, response parsing, and error handling with rate limiting and timeout logic.",
			"reasoning": "Interfacing with an external AI API involves constructing prompts, managing API calls, parsing responses, and handling errors robustly. These distinct concerns warrant separate subtasks to ensure reliability and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend Application Setup with React",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the frontend setup into subtasks for project initialization with Vite, routing configuration, folder structure setup, and state management integration.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a React frontend includes initializing the project, configuring routing, organizing components, and integrating state management. These foundational steps are discrete and can be effectively managed as subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Category Filtering System (API and UI)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the category filtering system into subtasks for backend API endpoint creation, frontend category selector component development, and integration with idea generation flow.",
			"reasoning": "This task spans backend API development and frontend UI implementation with state management. Splitting into API, UI, and integration subtasks will clarify responsibilities and testing scope."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Guest Mode Idea Generation Flow",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the guest mode idea generation into subtasks for public API endpoint creation, frontend prompt input UI, category selection integration, and result display with loading states.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a complete guest user flow involves backend API, frontend input and selection components, and UI state management for loading and results, each requiring focused development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend User Registration and Login Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the frontend authentication integration into subtasks for registration form, login form, JWT storage and management, and authenticated API request handling.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating authentication on the frontend involves form creation, API communication, token management, and secure request handling, which are logically separable subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Idea Saving and Retrieval for Registered Users",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the idea saving and retrieval task into subtasks for protected API endpoints (save and fetch), frontend save button UI, and integration with user authentication state.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires backend security, API design, frontend UI updates, and integration with authentication, making it suitable for subdivision into focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "User Dashboard for Saved Ideas",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the dashboard development into subtasks for fetching saved ideas, rendering ideas with filtering controls, and handling empty or loading states.",
			"reasoning": "The dashboard involves data fetching, UI rendering with filtering, and user experience considerations for empty/loading states, which can be effectively managed as separate subtasks."
